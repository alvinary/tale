-- These are the rules for ferrying:
-- * The farmer can't ferry the wolf from one place to another
-- * The farmer cannot ferry the cabbage and the goat at the same time
-- (otherwise they can just take both to the docks on the first turn
-- and be done)
-- * The farmer can't ferry you from place A to B starting at place B.
-- * If you are transported by ferry at time t, you'll be at the opposite part
-- of the river on t + 1 
-- * The farmer drives the ferry, and cannot just send you off from A to B
-- and stay at A.
-- * Anything that's not ferried stays where it is
