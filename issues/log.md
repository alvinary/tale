### Todos

Modeling
* PDL planning
* PDL planning with integer variables
* Composition
    * with types
    * with unary predicates
* Natural deduction
* Tagging tiles
* Multiplication

Features
* Indexed sorts
    * Notation
    * Semantics
    * Implementation
* Parameter passing from CLI (for the size of a sort, for instance)
* Optimization (in pipeline.py, optimizing with respect to a given relation)

### Done
* `let A.f : B`
* Quadratic embedding of trees (vs. naive cubic)
* Quadratic embedding of functions
* Obtaining strings from a fixed grammar
* Addition
* Eight Queens
* Avoid cubic embedding of `assign(a, b), r(b, c) -> s(a, c)`
